 * Helper function.  Reads up to BUFFER_SIZE from a file descriptor into a
 * buffer and calls process_key_value() when for each and every key-value
 * pair that is read from the file descriptor.
 *
 * Each key-value must be in a "Key: Value" format, identical to MP1, and
 * each pair must be terminated by a newline ('\n').
 *
 * Each unique file descriptor must have a unique buffer and the buffer
 * must be of size (BUFFER_SIZE + 1).  Therefore, if you have two
 * unique file descriptors, you must have two buffers that each have
 * been malloc()'d to size (BUFFER_SIZE + 1).
 *
 * Note that read_from_fd() makes a read() call and will block if the
 * fd does not have data ready to be read.  This function is complete
 * and does not need to be modified as part of this MP.
 *
 * @param fd
 *    File descriptor to read from.
 * @param buffer
 *    A unique buffer associated with the fd.  This buffer may have
 *    a partial key-value pair between calls to read_from_fd() and
 *    must not be modified outside the context of read_from_fd().
 * @param mr
 *    Pass-through mapreduce_t structure (to process_key_value()).
 *
 * @retval 1
 *    Data was available and was read successfully.
 * @retval 0
 *    The file descriptor fd has been closed, no more data to read.
 * @retval -1
 *    The call to read() produced an error.
